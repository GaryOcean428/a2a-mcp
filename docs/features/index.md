## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Real-time | API Key Required | Rate Limits | Typical Use Cases |
|---------|-----------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Web Search | Yes | Yes | 20/min per tool | Research, fact-checking, content aggregation |
| Form Automation | Yes | Yes | 20/min per tool | Customer onboarding, data submission, form testing |
| Vector Storage | Yes | Yes | 20/min per tool | AI memory, semantic search, knowledge bases |
| Data Scraping | No* | Yes | 20/min per tool | Price monitoring, content aggregation, data collection |

*Data scraping operations may take longer depending on the complexity of the target website.

## Integration Examples

Check out these examples of integrating multiple features:

- [Building an AI research assistant](../tutorials/research-assistant.md) - Combines web search and vector storage
- [Creating a competitive price monitor](../tutorials/price-monitor.md) - Uses data scraping with scheduled automation
- [Implementing a knowledge retrieval system](../tutorials/knowledge-retrieval.md) - Leverages vector storage for semantic search

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate rate limiting** - Implement exponential backoff for retries
2. **Cache results when possible** - Reduce API calls for frequently accessed data
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - Implement robust error handling for all API calls
4. **Respect website policies** - Follow terms of service when using form automation and data scraping
5. **Optimize vector storage** - Use appropriate chunking and metadata for best results
