# MCP Integration Platform TODO List

This document outlines the tasks needed to improve the MCP Integration Platform, including UI rendering fixes, documentation enhancements, and feature implementations.

## CRITICAL UI RENDERING ISSUES

The MCP Integration Platform is currently experiencing severe UI rendering issues that prevent proper display of the interface. The analysis of the current state shows the following problems:

1. **CSS Loading Failure**: The core Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI component styles are failing to load properly in production.

2. **Component Structure Problems**: The sidebar, gradients, and text transparency effects are broken due to improper component rendering.

3. **Ineffective CSS Recovery**: Current inline style fixes are insufficient to address the systemic CSS architecture failure.

4. **Bundling Configuration Issue**: The Vite production build is incorrectly configured for CSS processing.

5. **WebSocket Connection Problems**: HMR and real-time updates are failing due to WebSocket connection issues.

These issues have been prioritized as Phase 0 in the implementation plan below and must be addressed before any other enhancements.

## 1. Documentation Structure Enhancements

- [x] Add a table of contents to README.md for improved navigation
- [x] Create consistent headings hierarchy across all documentation
- [x] Implement cross-links between related documentation sections
- [x] Create a dedicated getting started guide
- [x] Organize documentation into logical collections (api_docs, tutorials, deployment_guides)

## 2. API Documentation Improvements

- [ ] Use OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for all API endpoints
- [ ] Expand API call examples to include complete request-response pairs
- [ ] Add error response examples and error handling guidance
- [x] Create code snippets in multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- [ ] Document rate limiting policies with practical examples

## 3. Feature Documentation Expansion

- [x] Expand Web Search feature documentation with detailed provider comparisons
- [x] Create step-by-step tutorials for Form Automation feature
- [x] Add comprehensive guide for Vector Storage functionality
- [x] Create detailed examples for Data Scraping with pagination
- [x] Include real-world use cases for each feature

## 4. User Onboarding Improvements

- [ ] Create an interactive quickstart guide
- [x] Clearly document all prerequisites and dependencies
- [x] Add environment setup instructions for local development
- [x] Provide sample configuration files
- [x] Create a step-by-step first API call walkthrough

## 5. Support and Troubleshooting Enhancements

- [x] Create dedicated section on error handling
- [x] Add comprehensive FAQ section
- [x] Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
- [x] Provide clearer contact information for maintainers
- [x] Add community contribution guidelines

## 6. Documentation Accessibility Improvements

- [ ] Consider using documentation generators like MkDocs or Sphinx
- [ ] Ensure proper contrast and heading structure for accessibility
- [ ] Add alt text for all images and diagrams
- [ ] Make documentation mobile-friendly
- [ ] Add search functionality to documentation

## 7. Documentation Testing and Validation

- [ ] Verify links in documentation work correctly
- [ ] Test code examples to ensure they execute correctly
- [ ] Review documentation for technical accuracy
- [ ] Gather user feedback on documentation improvements
- [ ] Create a system for ongoing documentation maintenance

## 8. Integration-Specific Documentation

- [ ] Enhance Cline VS Code extension integration guide
- [ ] Add more examples for integration with common frameworks
- [ ] Create language-specific integration tutorials
- [ ] Document security best practices for integrations
- [ ] Provide configuration templates for popular environments

## 9. UI Rendering Critical Fixes

- [ ] **Create Critical CSS Base File**
  - [ ] Extract all critical styles from Tailwind directly into a static CSS file
  - [ ] Include this file in the HTML head with inline styles rather than as a linked stylesheet
  - [ ] Ensure styles are available immediately on page load

- [ ] **Fix Component Layout Structure**
  - [ ] Redesign the Layout component to properly handle the sidebar positioning
  - [ ] Implement proper z-indexing and positioning for overlays and navigation elements
  - [ ] Ensure the sidebar is properly styled and positioned as an overlay on mobile

- [ ] **Configure Proper CSS Extraction**
  - [ ] Update the Vite configuration to use `vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js` for critical CSS paths
  - [ ] Add safeguards against CSS purging for critical UI elements
  - [ ] Update Tailwind config to preserve all essential UI classes

- [ ] **Add Reliable WebSocket Transport**
  - [ ] Fix the WebSocket connection configuration to work properly in the Replit environment
  - [ ] Implement fallback mechanism when WebSocket connection fails
  - [ ] Ensure real-time updates work consistently

- [ ] **Implement Basic CSS Fail-safe**
  - [ ] Create a basic CSS file with minimal styling that ensures the UI is usable even if Tailwind fails
  - [ ] This should include grid layouts, typography, and basic component styles
  - [ ] Add specific non-purged styling for critical UI elements
