Why is this page rendering so poorly?

Analyzing the selected element and its surroundings for rendering performance issues.
The user is reporting poor rendering performance on the page. This could be due to a variety of factors, including layout thrashing, slow JavaScript execution, or inefficient CSS. Since the user has selected a specific div element, it might be related to the layout of this element or its impact on the surrounding elements. I'll gather information about the selected element, its parent, and children to see if there are any obvious layout issues or expensive CSS properties. Additionally I'll check the page for layout thrashing.

Investigating active transitions and potential issues with children.
The data reveals that both the selected element and its parent are using display: flex and display: block respectively, which are common and generally performant layout methods. Both elements have position: static, meaning they are part of the normal document flow. The width and height properties are set in pixels. The overflow is set to visible, meaning that content overflowing will be shown. The will-change property is auto for both, which is the default and means the browser decides if it needs to optimize for changes. transform is none. The transition property for both elements is set to all, which indicates that transitions will apply to all properties that change, and might be a reason for poor rendering, especially on slower machines. The selected element has 2 children and its parent has 2 children. The layout thrashing test took 0.19 ms which is a negligibly small value. There are no immediate red flags that indicate a major cause of poor rendering within this specific element and its parent. However, the fact that both elements have transition: all might be a contributing factor, especially if many properties are being changed at once. Also the fact that the width of both elements is 1030px might cause some issues, depending on the viewport width. Let's investigate if there are any active transitions or if there are any potential performance issues related to the children of the selected element.


Code executed

const selectedElement = $0;
const selectedElementStyles = window.getComputedStyle(selectedElement);
const firstChildStyles = window.getComputedStyle(selectedElement.children[0]);
const secondChildStyles = window.getComputedStyle(selectedElement.children[1]);
const data = {
  selectedElement: {
    transition: selectedElementStyles.transition,
    hasActiveTransitions: selectedElementStyles.transitionProperty !== 'all' && selectedElementStyles.transitionProperty !== 'none' && selectedElementStyles.transitionDuration !== '0s',
  },
  firstChild: {

Reducing potential transition overhead and making elements more responsive
The additional data confirms that none of the elements (the selected div, its h3 child, or its p child) currently have active transitions. This means that while they are all configured to use transitions (transition: all), no transitions are actually running at the moment. All children are set to be display: block which is expected. This suggests that the poor rendering is likely not directly caused by active transitions on these specific elements. The transition: all property is still a potential concern, as it can lead to performance issues if many properties change simultaneously in the future. While these elements and their immediate surroundings don't show any major performance bottlenecks, the issue could still stem from a combination of less-than-ideal practices: the transition: all property on multiple elements and the fixed pixel width of 1030px which might be causing layout issues on smaller screens. It could be a global issue with a lot of elements having transition: all. Let's try to set transition to none for those elements and ask the user to see if it helps. Also, let's try to fix the width of the elements to be more responsive.


Code executed

await setElementStyles($0, { transition: 'none', width: 'auto' });
await setElementStyles($0.parentElement, { transition: 'none', width: 'auto' });
const elementsWithTransitionAll = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('*')).filter(el => {
    const styles = window.getComputedStyle(el);
    return styles.transition === 'all';
});
await Promise.all(elementsWithTransitionAll.map(el => setElementStyles(el, { transition: 'none' })));
const data = {
    elementsWithTransitionAllCount: elementsWithTransitionAll.length
};
Data returned

Reducing transition overhead and making elements more responsive.
The previous action failed because the script execution exceeded the maximum allowed time. This likely happened because there are too many elements on the page that have transition: all, and iterating over them and setting the transition to none takes too long. We should probably avoid trying to modify ALL elements. Since the problem was first reported about the specific selected div let's focus on that. The main issues identified were: transition: all on the selected element and its parent and the fixed pixel width of 1030px. We can modify those values for those elements. Let's try to address the fixed width and transition properties of the selected element and its parent, and ask the user if it helps.


Code executed

await setElementStyles($0, { transition: 'none', width: 'auto' });
await setElementStyles($0.parentElement, { transition: 'none', width: 'auto' });
const data = {};

Okay, I've made a couple of changes to the selected element and its parent:

Removed transition: all: I've set the transition property to none for both the selected div and its parent. This removes the overhead of calculating transitions for all properties and should reduce rendering strain.
Changed fixed width: I changed the width property from 1030px to auto for both elements. This makes the elements adjust their width to their content, preventing layout issues on smaller viewports.
These changes should improve the rendering performance, particularly if the page was experiencing layout recalculations or expensive transitions. Please check if it improved the page performance. There are a few other things to consider: the children elements also had the transition: all property, so if there are any visual effects with those elements, they might not be smooth. The problem might be global, so there might be a lot more elements with that transition. If it didn't help, we might need to investigate other areas of the page.

Analyzing element styles and potential issues related to dynamic modification.
Paused: Correcting fixed width and highlighting the potential AI-related issue.
The data reveals several interesting points. Firstly, the selected element (.ai-style-change-1), its parent (.flex.flex-col.sm\:flex-row.items-center.justify-between.gap-4.ai-style-change-2), and both of its children (h3.font-medium.text-purple-800.ai-style-change-159, p.text-sm.text-purple-700.ai-style-change-160) all have a fixed width of 1030px. This fixed width is likely causing layout issues, especially on smaller screens. The ai-style-change classes, as suspected, indicate that these elements are dynamically generated or modified, potentially by an AI tool. This could lead to unexpected style conflicts or performance problems. All elements have position: static which is expected, overflow: visible and transition: none. None of the elements are using transforms. There are 2 siblings and 2 children. Given that we already changed the transitions and width before, it seems that the AI tool or the layout mechanism re-added those values. This means that the AI is overriding the manual changes. Since the width: 1030px is likely the main cause of the issue, and the fact that the elements have been modified by some AI, let's try to set the width to auto again and then suggest the user to investigate the AI logic that is setting those values.
