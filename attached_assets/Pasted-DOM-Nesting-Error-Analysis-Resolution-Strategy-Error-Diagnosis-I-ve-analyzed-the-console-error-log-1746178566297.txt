DOM Nesting Error Analysis & Resolution Strategy
Error Diagnosis
I've analyzed the console error log, which shows a critical React DOM nesting violation:
Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): <div> cannot appear as a descendant of <p>.
This error occurs in your application's component hierarchy where an invalid HTML structure is being created. Specifically, a <div> element is being rendered inside a <p> element, which violates HTML nesting rules.
Error Localization
The problem is located in your Card component implementation, specifically:

Primary location: src/components/ui/card.tsx:92:12
Component context: Used within a Radix UI Tabs implementation inside the WebSocketTest component

Root Cause Analysis
Based on the stack trace, this is a common issue with shadcn/ui Card components when using its sub-components incorrectly. The most likely scenarios are:

CardDescription component is rendered as a <p> element, but content being passed to it contains <div> elements
Complex content with block-level elements is being nested inside paragraph-based components

Resolution Strategy
To resolve this issue, implement the following targeted changes:
Approach 1: Fix Usage in WebSocketTest Component
Look at src/pages/WebSocketTest.tsx around line 44 where the Card component is used:
tsx// Find where a Card component is being used like this:
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>
      {/* PROBLEM: Complex content with divs here */}
      <div>This causes the nesting error</div>
    </CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  {/* ... */}
</Card>
Replace any <div> elements inside CardDescription with <span> elements or text content only:
tsx<CardDescription>
  This is text content only
  <span className="block mt-2">This uses span instead of div</span>
</CardDescription>
Approach 2: Modify Card Component
If the first approach doesn't work or you need to support complex content within CardDescription, modify the Card component:

Open src/components/ui/card.tsx
Find the CardDescription implementation (around line 92)
Change the underlying element from <p> to <div>:

tsx// Before:
const CardDescription = React.forwardRef
  HTMLParagraphElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLParagraphElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <p
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("text-sm text-muted-foreground", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))

// After:
const CardDescription = React.forwardRef
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("text-sm text-muted-foreground", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))
Additional Issues
The log also indicates missing CSS classes that need to be addressed:
[CSS Recovery] Missing critical styles: bg-gradient-to-r, text-transparent, feature-card
Ensure these Tailwind classes are properly included in your project:

Check if bg-gradient-to-r and text-transparent are standard Tailwind classes that should be included
For feature-card, add this custom class to your CSS or ensure it's defined in your Tailwind configuration

Implementation Steps

First check WebSocketTest.tsx to identify improper Card usage
If found, refactor the content to avoid nesting divs inside p elements
If not found or if changes aren't feasible, modify the Card component as described
Address the missing CSS classes by updating your Tailwind configuration

This structured approach will resolve the DOM nesting error while maintaining the component's functionality and appearance.
