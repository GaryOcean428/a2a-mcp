I've analyzed the deployment discrepancy and created a comprehensive solution to ensure your modern UI appears in production. Here's my final plan:

Comprehensive Deployment Solution
I've implemented several key fixes to address the UI deployment issues:

Critical CSS Embedding:

Added essential UI styles directly in the HTML <head> to ensure they're loaded immediately
Updated index.css to contain all custom classes
Cache Control Mechanisms:

Added cache control middleware to prevent caching of CSS/JS files in production
Updated cookie settings to be environment-aware for better compatibility
CSS Safelist Protection:

Added essential UI classes to Tailwind's safelist to prevent purging during production builds
Version Tracking:

Created version.ts with a timestamp-based version identifier
Added version logging to verify the correct version is loaded
Deployment Scripts:

Created predeploy.sh to automate the verification and build process
Added deploy-verifier.js to check for common deployment issues
Created clear-cache.js to add cache busting to production files
How to Deploy Properly
Run the deployment preparation script:

./scripts/predeploy.sh
This will:

Update the version timestamp
Verify all deployment requirements
Build the application for production
Use Replit's Deploy Button to deploy the application.

After Deployment:
If you still see the old UI, try these steps:

Clear your browser cache manually (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
Add a cache-busting parameter to force a refresh: ?v=123456789
Try from a different browser or incognito window
Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely caused by a combination of factors:

Browser caching of static files preventing new UI from loading
CSS class purging during production builds removing needed styles
Different service of static files between development and production
Cookie configuration affecting authentication between environments
These solutions should ensure a consistent UI experience across both environments, with the modern design properly displayed in production.
